# Task Management Application

This project is a Task Management Application built using React. It provides an intuitive interface to manage tasks, update task priorities, and sort/filter tasks based on status and deadlines. The app is integrated with a backend API for task data management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in and register accounts to manage their tasks.
- **Task Management**: Add, update, and delete tasks. Each task includes details like name, priority, and due date.
- **Task Sorting and Filtering**: Tasks can be sorted by priority and due date, helping users prioritize their work efficiently.
- **Task Priority Update**: Users can change the priority of a task, which updates both the frontend and backend.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is mobile-friendly, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.

## Working

1. **Login & Registration**: Users first register or log in to access their task dashboard.
2. **Dashboard**: After logging in, the user can see all tasks, sort them by priority or due date, and manage their tasks.
3. **Task Management**: Users can add new tasks, update existing ones, change priorities, or delete tasks.
4. **Backend API Integration**: The application communicates with a backend API for task-related operations (fetching, updating, and deleting tasks).
5. **Toast Notifications**: Actions like task creation, deletion, and priority updates are accompanied by real-time notifications.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, `react-router-dom` for routing, `react-toastify` for notifications, and CSS for styling.
- **Backend API**: The app communicates with a backend API for managing tasks, built with Node.js or Django (depending on your choice).
- **State Management**: React's state and hooks are used for managing application state.
- **Routing**: `react-router-dom` enables navigation between different pages such as login, registration, and task management.

This Task Management application is a simple yet effective tool for organizing tasks with features focused on productivity and ease of use.
